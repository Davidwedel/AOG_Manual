# AgOpenGPS Beginner Manual

This is not a complete manual dealing with creating fields/AB Lines/etc.
Rather, it is to help employees learn how to change vehicles, fields, ab lines etc.
If you try to learn AOG from here, you will be frustrated.
However, if you print this and put it in your tractor cab to teach your coworker the basics of using AOG, it should work ok.
